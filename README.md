# Machine Learning Project - Spring 2024

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Machine Learning course** at the **Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence**. The goal is to analyze and build machine learning models using one of the three provided datasets. The models will be built, tested, and compared based on their performance using various machine learning algorithms, including **SVM**, **Neural Networks**, and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.

## Datasets
The following datasets were provided for this project. The team selected one for the experiments:
- [Gender Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset)
- [Garbage Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2)
- [Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-Ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bmadushanirodrigo/fracture-multi-region-x-ray-data)

## Requirements
### Data Preparation:
1. Reshape RGB images to dimensions of **(64, 64, 3)**.
2. Convert the images from RGB to greyscale.
3. Normalize the images.

### Experiments and Results:
- **First Experiment:**
  - Train an **SVM model** on greyscale images.
  - Evaluate the model with the **confusion matrix** and **average F1 score**.
  
- **Second Experiment:**
  - Build and train **two different Neural Networks** with different architectures.
  - Plot the **error** and **accuracy** curves for both training and validation data.
  - Save the best model and test it, presenting the **confusion matrix** and **F1 score**.

- **Third Experiment:**
  - Train a **CNN on greyscale images** and plot the learning curves.
  - Train a **CNN on RGB images** and plot the learning curves.
  - Save the best model, reload it, and provide the **confusion matrix** and **F1 score**.

- **Comparison**: Compare the results of all models and recommend the best performing model.
